# TFL Tube Checker

Using the publically available [TFL API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/apis) to access London tube service information, and search for incoming trains at your tube station of choice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a test project to showcase some neat JS concepts, coded using a modern JS framework and supplemented with other modern industry-standard packages.

## Technologies used

- Front-end JS Framework: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- CSS: Tailwind
- API: Transport for London (TFL) API library

## To add in the future

- Comprehensive search feature, as many tube stations serve multiple tube lines. This will require updating the static dataset in the repo.
- Commit your tube station to local storage, to view as a list of favourites on the home page. This will require local storage.
- Expose more of the data in card form (delays, parts of the line that are down, view next day times). This may require a change of API endpoint.
